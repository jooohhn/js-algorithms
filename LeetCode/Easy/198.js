// 198. House Robber

// You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint
// stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police
// if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

// Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob
// tonight without alerting the police.
