// Reservoir sampling is a family of randomized algorithms for randomly choosing a sample of k items from a list S containing
// n items, where n is either a very large or unknown number. Typically, n is too large to fit the whole list into main memory.

// Observations:
// This means we don't know what n is. If we did, we would randomly take k numbers from 0 to n and add them to our sample.

// See:
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling

/**
 * @param {number} k The sample size
 * @param {LinkedList<number>} list The list which we are taking the random samples of
